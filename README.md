# Gender and Emotion Classifier

This repo aims to replicate the work done in the article _Arriaga, Octavio, Matias Valdenegro-Toro, and Paul Pl√∂ger. "Real-time convolutional neural networks for emotion and gender classification." arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.07557 (2017)._ The link of the paper is _https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07557.pdf _

We further aim to improve the model and build a live application based on this.

The directory structure is as follows:
1. notebooks/: All the under development code will be placed in this. Once the code base is finalised, we'll migrate it to the respective directory.
2. data/: This consists of the datasets that we'll be using (the datasets being used have already been cited in the paper).
3. model/: The directory contains the coomplete net for gender and emotion classification.
